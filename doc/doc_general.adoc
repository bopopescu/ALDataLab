== References

In this project we have 3 main types of referenced data collection.
These are _AIP_, _MDM-ITC_ and _Storage Master Report_ which are kept on s3.

=== AIP

_AIP_ is data reference to list of servers and applications installed on them.

There are 3 main tables which are :

* _server_: list of all servers
* _application_: list of all business applications
* _softInstance_: which application is deployed on which server

Data is synchronized daily by batches and they are stored under s3://gerepo/.

Zeppelin notebook URLs are

=== MDM-ITC

This is the network topology which gives us any information about network elements. 
As an example, we are able to know what are the _IP ranges_ for a given _site_ thanks to these information.
These data are intended to be manually transferred into s3://gerepo/in/mdm-itc.
