=== AIP

Data is synchronized daily by batches and they are stored under s3://gerepo/.

Zeppelin notebook URL: https://devzeppelin.gadatalab.com/#/notebook/2BMCK757N
and https://devzeppelin.gadatalab.com/#/notebook/2BXZ39CTF


There are 3 main tables which are :

* _server_: list of all servers
* _application_: list of all business applications
* _softInstance_: which application is deployed on which server



=== IDM

IDM is the management of individual identities/users, their authentication, authorization, roles and privilieges within different sites, sectors, teams etc.




=== MDM-ITC

This is the network topology which gives us any information about network elements. 
As an example, we know what are the _IP ranges_ for a given _site_.
These data are intended to be manually transferred into s3://gerepo/in/mdm-itc.
