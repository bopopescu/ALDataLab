== Server usage

Another data sources that we collect to analyse is "server-usage".
It involves the information about server CPU usage, memory and storage usage.


An HTTP URL allows us to call and get these data for a single given server by specifying its hostname as a URL parameter.
As response, it is an XLS file returned which will be then converted to CSV format and stored on s3.


To know more about URL and other configurations, look into conf/conf.sh file.


There is a _server.lst_ CSV file which contains hostname of all servers for which we want to collect their usage information.
Server-usage data are synchronized 2 times in a week.


There is nothing to make anonymous for these kind of data collection.
