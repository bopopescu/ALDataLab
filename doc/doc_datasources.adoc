_Oracle logs_ are database access log files.
_Nexthink_ is the application which collects data about network connections, program executions, web requests, etc. from PCs, laptops or servers.
While Nexthink is mainly applied on Microsoft Windows systems, _Server sockets_ is implemented for Linux based machines.
Finally, _Server usage_ is data collection from servers, including their CPU, memory, storage usages, etc.
