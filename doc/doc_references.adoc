== References

In this project we have 3 main types of referenced data collection.
These are _AIP_, _MDM-ITC_ and _Storage Master Report_ which are kept on s3.

=== AIP

_AIP_ is data referential for all applications installed on different servers and used by different users.
In other words, AIP is a referential of the IT assets of Alstom and it covers mainly the list of applications,
the list of servers where the applications are deployed, the product software used by these applications,
the licenses used by the applications, etc.

There are 3 main tables which are :

* _server_: list of servers
* _application_: list of business applications
* _softInstance_: which application is deployed on which server

Data are synchronized daily by batches and they are stored under s3://gerepo/.

=== MDM-ITC

This is the network topology which gives us any information about network elements.
As an example, we are able to know what are the _IP ranges_ for a given _site_ thanks to these information.
Today, these data are manually transferred into s3://gerepo/in/mdm-itc.

NOTE: _IDM_ is the management of individual identities/users, their authentication, authorization,
roles and privileges within different sites, sectors, teams etc.

=== IDM

_IDM_ is used to resolve user information which are made anonymous before being stored on s3.
However, we don't need IDM to anonymize data.
