== References

We are mainly focused on 4 types of referential data collection which
are _AIP_, _MDM-ITC_, _Storage Master Report_ and _IDM_.
They are listed in the following figure with their paths on *s3://gerepo*.

=== AIP

_AIP_ (Application Inventory Portal) is data referential for all applications installed on different servers and used by different users.
In other words, AIP is a referential of the IT assets of Ge-Alstom and it covers mainly the list of applications,
the list of servers on which these applications are deployed, the product software used by these applications,
the licenses used by the applications, etc.

There are 3 main tables which are :

* _server_: list of servers
* _application_: list of business applications
* _softInstance_: which application is deployed on which server

Data are synchronized daily by batches and they are stored under s3://gerepo/.

=== MDM-ITC

This is the network topology which gives us any information about network elements.
As an example, we are able to know what are the _IP ranges_ for a given _site_ thanks to these information.
Today, these data are manually transferred into s3://gerepo/in/mdm-itc.

=== IDM

_IDM_ is the management of individual identities/users, their authentication, authorization,
roles and privileges within different sites, sectors, teams etc.

In short, _IDM_ is the list of users with their corresponding sectors, sites, teams etc.

_IDM_ is used to resolve user information which are made anonymous before being stored on s3.
However, we don't need IDM to anonymize data.
